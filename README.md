# 🌸 Beautify.css

**Beautify.css** is a lightweight, utility-first CSS framework built with pure CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Designed to be modular, readable, and production-ready, it aims to simplify frontend development without relying on heavy dependencies or complex build tools.

> Inspired by Tailwind, but handcrafted with simplicity in mind.
